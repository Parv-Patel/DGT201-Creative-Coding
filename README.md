# CPU Scheduling Processes Simulator (DGT201-Creative-Coding)

## Functionality:

### Algorithm Selection:
- Users can switch between FCFS, SJF, and Round Robin algorithms using a dropdown menu 
- Adjustable time quantum for Round Robin algorithm using a slider

### Process Visualization:
- Displays process information including ID, arrival time, burst time, remaining time, and status
- Color-coded processes blocks for easy identification
- Real-time execution of timeline
- Visual representation of waiting queue and current executing process

### Interactive Controls:
- Space bar to pause/replay simulation
- 'R' key to restart or restart simulation
- Time quantum adjustment slider for Round Robin

### Visual Elements:
- Color-coded process blocks
